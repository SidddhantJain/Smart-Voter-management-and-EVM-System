# VoteGuard Pro: A Secure, Accessible, and Auditable Electronic Voting System Prototype

This document is intentionally written in an academic, research-oriented style to serve as a foundation for a peer-reviewed publication. It articulates the system vision, research motivation, architectural design, security and trust model, accessibility-first constraints, implementation details, evaluation strategy, limitations, and future scope of the Smart Voter Management and EVM System (hereafter, VoteGuard Pro).

## 1. Project Title

VoteGuard Pro: A Security-First, Accessibility-Constrained Prototype for Auditable Electronic Voting with Biometric Sensing and Blockchain-Ready Persistence

## 2. Research Motivation & Problem Statement

Electronic voting systems continue to face scrutiny regarding correctness, verifiability, inclusivity, and resilience. Many systems emphasize device security and tabulation integrity while underweighting accessibility, human-centered flow, and transparent auditability for end-users and observers. Furthermore, real-world deployments must balance biometric sensing, privacy preservation, and operational robustness in constrained environments. This work proposes a prototype that foregrounds security and accessibility as co-equal design constraints, explores practical auditability via encrypted local storage with a pathway to immutable recording, and demonstrates an end-to-end voter journey with biometric capture and visual feedback.

Problem Statement: How can an electronic voting prototype be designed to simultaneously prioritize (i) security of vote handling, (ii) trust and transparency through auditability, and (iii) accessibility and inclusivity for diverse user populations, while remaining operationally viable in constrained environments and amenable to future blockchain-backed integrity guarantees?

## 3. Research Objectives & Contributions

This work presents the following contributions:

- Security-First Architecture: A modular prototype emphasizing encrypted local vote storage (Fernet), clear trust boundaries, and audit logging designed for operator and observer transparency.
- Accessibility as a System Constraint: A voter journey and UI flow designed for cognitive, visual, and motor accessibility, with emphasis on clear sequencing, error-handling, and assistive overlays.
- Biometric and Analytics Integration: Practical camera-driven face detection with emotion and demographic inference modules to study human factors, device readiness, and anomaly signals (prototype-only, non-binding to outcomes).
- Auditability Pathway: A local encrypted ledger with a conceptual pathway to blockchain-backed immutability, separating correctness from transparency while enabling progressive assurance.
- Prototype-Level Trust Modeling: An explicit articulation of threat assumptions, boundaries, and recovery modes to support rigorous security analysis.
- Research-Ready Documentation: A system design narrative structured for conversion into formal sections of a research paper (Introduction, Architecture, Security, Accessibility, Evaluation, Discussion).

## 4. Conceptual System Overview

The system models an accessible, sequenced voter journey: identifier intake (Aadhaar + Voter ID), biometric capture, candidate selection, visual confirmation, and secure persistence. Design principles:

- Security-first: Encrypted storage, minimal exposed surfaces, explicit trust boundaries, and double-vote prevention via cast registry.
- Accessibility-first: Reduced cognitive load, large interactive elements, clear confirmation dialogs, timed visualizations, and structured error paths.
- Transparency: User-visible visualizations of the casting flow and operational audit trails (encrypted logs), with a clear conceptual handoff to blockchain.
- Modularity: Separation of UI, hardware abstraction, cryptographic storage, blockchain client, and ML utilities to reduce coupling and enable independent evaluation.

Trust boundaries are explicitly defined between UI, device drivers, cryptographic storage, and any blockchain client. No implicit trust is granted to biometric models, which are treated as auxiliary analytics.

## 5. System Architecture

The architecture is layered: UI, Hardware Abstraction, Backend Storage, Blockchain Client (placeholder), ML Utilities, and Security/Audit Utilities.

Textual Diagram (conceptual):

```
User → UI (PyQt) → Backend (Encrypted Storage) → Audit Log
								 ↘ Hardware Abstraction (Camera/Biometric) → ML Utilities
								 ↘ Visualization (Vote Flow) → Blockchain Client (placeholder)
```

Data Flow Narrative:

1. The user provides identifiers (Aadhaar, Voter ID) and proceeds to biometric capture.
2. The camera subsystem detects faces; overlays provide emotion and demographic estimates for operator awareness (prototype analytics, not decision gates).
3. The voter selects a candidate; the system visualizes the casting action (paper chain metaphor, ballot box animation). Timing is controlled to avoid UI overlap.
4. The vote is serialized and encrypted using a Fernet key; the encrypted ledger is appended and stored locally.
5. An audit logger writes encrypted operational messages. A blockchain client placeholder demonstrates the intended immutable pathway.

## 6. Core Modules & Components

Primary directories are under `Phase 1A - Foundation/Month 3 - Prototype Development/EVM IoT Application/src` with additional scripts and documentation in the repository root.

- UI (`src/ui`): `main_ui.py`, `aadhaar_entry.py`, `biometric_capture.py`, `voting_screen.py`, plus optional visualization dialog and helpers. Responsibilities: orchestrate the voter journey, manage screen transitions, present overlays, and trigger persistence.
- Backend (`src/backend`): `vote_storage.py` (Fernet-encrypted JSON ledger), `blockchain_simulation.py` (PoW demo; not wired to UI). Responsibilities: secure local storage and auditability pathway.
- Blockchain (`src/blockchain`): `client.py` (web3 placeholder), `crypto_bridge.py` (Rust FFI stub), `crypto.rs` (source sketch). Responsibilities: conceptual on-chain submission and cryptographic primitives; these are not production-ready.
- Hardware (`src/hardware`): `device_manager.py`, `biometric.py`, and C++ stubs. Responsibilities: device initialization and capture abstraction. Actual `.so/.dll` drivers are not included.
- ML (`src/ml`): `emotion_recognizer.py` (FER+ ONNX; Haar-cascade fallback; temporal smoothing), `demographics_recognizer.py` (Caffe/ONNX age-gender), and other analytics modules. Responsibilities: auxiliary signals and operator observability.
- Security (`src/security`): `secure_boot.py` placeholder. Responsibilities: integrity checks and attestation concept.
- Utils (`src/utils`): `logger.py` for encrypted audit log; other helpers.
- Scripts: `scripts/demo_camera_detection.py` for camera/overlay demonstration; `docs/vote_blockchain_graph.html` for visualization output.

Rationale: Modularity supports independent security analysis, accessibility evaluation, and performance studies. The storage module isolates cryptographic responsibilities; UI isolates human factors; ML utilities are optional and sandboxed.

## 7. Security & Trust Model

Threat Assumptions:

- Adversaries may attempt to tamper with device drivers, intercept storage writes, or manipulate UI flows.
- Network adversaries are out of scope for the current prototype (no production blockchain connectivity).
- ML models may produce biased or incorrect inferences; they are not trusted for access control decisions.

Trust Boundaries:

- UI ↔ Hardware: Device outputs are untrusted and validated minimally; camera feeds are used for overlays, not decisions.
- UI ↔ Storage: Storage operations are trusted post-encryption; persistent artifacts are encrypted and append-only by design.
- UI ↔ Blockchain Client: Conceptual only; actual network submission is not performed.

Protections:

- Cryptographic Storage: Votes are encrypted via `cryptography.Fernet` with a file-based key. The ledger is append-only, re-encrypted on write.
- Double-Vote Prevention: A cast registry prevents re-voting by identifiers within the session context.
- Audit Logging: Operational events are encrypted and recorded to preserve transparency while limiting sensitive exposure.

Attack Surface Analysis:

- Key Management: Keys stored locally are vulnerable if not managed externally; the design recommends secure key stores and rotation.
- FFI Boundaries: Hardware/Rust libraries are placeholders; production use requires signed artifacts, integrity checks, and sandboxing.
- UI Manipulation: Timing and dialog sequencing have been hardened to prevent overlapping events; further state machine formalization is recommended.

Failure & Recovery:

- Decryption Errors: Storage reinitialization and operator alerts; recovery procedures must ensure integrity of prior writes.
- Device Failures: Fallback to simulation paths; operator notification.
- ML Failures: Overlays degrade gracefully to “Unknown”; no effect on voting capability.

## 8. Accessibility & Inclusive Design

Accessibility is treated as a correctness constraint. The voter journey emphasizes clarity, predictability, and minimal cognitive load. UI components are designed to support diverse users, including those with visual, motor, cognitive, or linguistic differences.

Design Principles and Practices:

- Clear Sequencing: Modal dialogs and controlled timing avoid overlapping visual events and reduce confusion.
- Readability: High-contrast styles and large targets; avoid rapid, distracting animations.
- Error Recovery: Explicit messages with descriptive guidance; no silent failures.
- Cognitive Load: Simplified flows; consistent placement and wording; minimal required memory.
- Assistive Signals: Overlays and confirmations that reinforce actions without reliance on complex icons.

Alignment: The design aims toward WCAG-aligned practices (perceptible, operable, understandable) and treats accessibility failures as system correctness failures, not cosmetic defects.

## 9. Implementation Details

- Languages & Frameworks: Python (PyQt5, OpenCV, NumPy), optional TensorFlow/ONNXRuntime for ML, C++ stubs for devices, Rust stub for crypto.
- Platform: Windows development (PowerShell), prototype-level camera access.
- Key Algorithms: Face detection via Haar cascades; optional emotion via FER+; age/gender via Caffe or ONNX; temporal smoothing of emotion labels to reduce noise.
- Storage: Fernet-encrypted JSON ledger; append-only semantics; cast registry for re-vote prevention.
- Visualization: PyQt-based animated flow demonstrating casting and blockchain pathway; HTML graph for conceptual demonstration.

## 10. Operational Workflow

End-to-End Lifecycle:

1. Initialize UI and (optional) secure boot placeholder.
2. Collect Aadhaar and Voter ID; validate basic format.
3. Capture camera frames; detect faces; display overlays (optional ML). Warn on multiple faces.
4. Present ballot; upon selection, visualize casting and append encrypted vote to ledger.
5. Record encrypted audit messages; optionally handoff to blockchain client placeholder.
6. Return to start; prevent re-voting for the same identifiers within session via registry.

Error Handling Paths:

- Missing Camera: Operator notification; fallback simulation.
- Storage Exceptions: Alert and safe rollback semantics; operator remediation.
- ML Model Absence: Overlays degrade to “Unknown”; no impact on core casting.

## 11. Evaluation Strategy

The system is prepared for evaluation along four axes:

- Security: Static analysis of storage and key handling; threat modeling of device and FFI boundaries; controlled adversarial testing of UI sequencing.
- Usability: Task completion rates, error rates, and time-to-cast metrics; qualitative interviews in lab settings.
- Accessibility: Heuristic WCAG alignment checks; screen-reader and high-contrast tests; cognitive walkthroughs for error recovery.
- Performance: Latency of capture-to-store; frame processing overhead; write amplification of encrypted ledger appends.

Metrics and Benchmarks: Define measurable targets (e.g., time-to-cast under 30s, zero overlapping modal events, encrypted write latency < 50ms on reference hardware). These are subject to empirical validation in future work.

## 12. Limitations & Assumptions

- Prototype Scope: Hardware drivers, Rust cryptographic libraries, and production blockchain connectivity are placeholders.
- Key Management: File-based keys are unsuitable for production; external secure key stores and rotation are recommended.
- ML Ethics: Demographic inference is optional and may be biased; it is not used for access control or eligibility decisions.
- Offline Bias: The system assumes constrained or offline environments; cloud assumptions are explicitly avoided.
- Regulatory Compliance: Not assessed; deployment would require jurisdiction-specific evaluation.

## 13. Future Scope & Research Extensions

- Immutable Recording: Integration with permissioned/public blockchain(s) with verifiable receipts.
- Cryptographic Hardening: TEEs, signed drivers, formal verification of storage code, and zero-knowledge proofs for privacy-preserving audits.
- Secure Operations: Role-based access, tamper-evident logs, remote attestation, and integrity monitoring.
- Accessibility Research: Formal evaluations with diverse user populations; multi-language support; auditory/tactile feedback channels.
- Human Factors: Systematic study of overlays and visualizations on user trust, comprehension, and error rates.
- Formal State Machines: Verified UI state transitions and recovery logic.

Entrypoints
- UI launch (root): `run_app.py` → `ui.main_ui.MainUI()`
- Orchestrator (prototype): `Phase 1A - Foundation/.../src/main.py` → devices + blockchain + `TouchscreenUI.run()`
- Touchscreen runner: `Phase 1A - Foundation/.../src/ui/touchscreen.py` (prints/logs flow)

---

## 3) System Architecture

- **Components:** UI (PyQt), Hardware Manager (biometric/camera), Backend Storage (Fernet JSON), Blockchain Client (web3 placeholder + Rust crypto FFI), ML (face/fingerprint/anomaly), Security (secure boot), Utils (logger).
- **Boundaries:**
	- UI ↔ Hardware (capture events via `DeviceManager`).
	- UI ↔ Backend (`VoteStorage.store_vote`).
	- UI ↔ Blockchain (`BlockchainClient.submit_vote` placeholder).
	- ML modules are callable utilities, not fully wired into UI flow.
- **Responsibilities:** UI drives state; backend ensures encrypted persistence; blockchain client prepares hashes/signatures and would post on-chain; hardware manager abstracts sensors.

---

## 4) Component Breakdown (Deep)

### UI (`src/ui`)
- **MainUI (`main_ui.py`):** `QStackedWidget` managing Aadhaar → Biometric screens; full-screen styling; transitions via index.
- **AadhaarEntryScreen (`aadhaar_entry.py`):** collects 12-digit Aadhaar + Voter ID; simple validation; advances to biometric.
- **BiometricCaptureScreen (`biometric_capture.py`):**
	- Camera feed via OpenCV; anomaly warning for multiple faces (CascadeClassifier).
	- Buttons to simulate fingerprint/retina/face; serial device connection stub; simulation mode fallback.
	- On face capture, transitions to `VotingScreen` with party list.
- **VotingScreen (`voting_screen.py`):** shows parties; on selection, calls `VoteStorage.store_vote` and shows success; returns to Aadhaar.
- **TouchscreenUI (`touchscreen.py`):** non-GUI runner that uses `DeviceManager` and `BlockchainClient` to simulate end-to-end flow and audit logs.

Error/Retry Paths
- Validation failure in Aadhaar: message box warning; remains in screen.
- Camera unavailable: error dialog; prevents start.
- Serial device connection failure: shows error; enables “Simulate Biometric Capture” fallback.
- Vote storage exceptions: handled implicitly via `VoteStorage` (no explicit try/except in UI — consider adding).

Dependencies
- `PyQt5`, `cv2`, `numpy`, `serial` (PySerial), internal backend.

### Backend Storage (`src/backend/vote_storage.py`)
- **Responsibilities:** Encrypted append-only JSON store using `cryptography.Fernet`.
- **Key Functions:**
	- `load_or_generate_key()`: loads `key.key` or creates one.
	- `store_vote(election_type, party_name, timestamp)`: decrypts, appends vote, re-encrypts.
	- `initialize_storage()`: reinitializes encrypted list.
- **Behavior:** Creates `votes.json` on first run as encrypted list. Prints stored vote.
- **Performance:** Small file encryption per write; acceptable for prototype; consider batching.
- **Error Handling:** Minimal; encryption/decryption exceptions would bubble.

### Blockchain (`src/blockchain`)
- **Client (`client.py`):**
	- Uses `web3` to connect (HTTP 8545). Contract address/ABI placeholders; no actual on-chain calls in `submit_vote`.
	- Hashes/signs via Rust FFI (`crypto_bridge.py`), then returns a dict with status/hash/signature.
- **CryptoBridge (`crypto_bridge.py`):** expects compiled `crypto.so` with functions `hash_vote`, `sign_vote`, `generate_keypair`, `verify_signature`. Not present in repository → “Not found in repository”.
- **Simulation (`backend/blockchain_simulation.py`):** independent PoW blockchain demo; unused by UI.

### Hardware (`src/hardware`)
- **DeviceManager:** orchestrates `FingerprintSensor`, `RetinaScanner`, `Camera` (Python FFI).
- **biometric.py:** loads `.so` libraries (`fingerprint_sensor.so`, `retina_scanner.so`, `camera.so`). Not present in repository → “Not found in repository”.
- **C++ stubs:** `.cpp`/`.h` drivers print initialization/capture; no build scripts present.

### ML (`src/ml`)
- **ArcFace:** loads Keras model from path; preprocesses image; computes embeddings; compares with threshold.
- **FingerprintRecognition:** ORB-based image matching simulation; reports success/failure.
- **AnomalyDetection:** percentile-based threshold calibration; detection.
- **RealTimeAnalytics:** simulated loop printing metrics.

### Security (`src/security/secure_boot.py`)
- Print-based secure boot integrity verification placeholder.

### Utils (`src/utils/logger.py`)
- Console logging + writes Fernet-encrypted lines to `audit_log.enc` using a hardcoded key → security risk.

## 5) Implementation Details (End-to-End Flow)

- **Entrypoint (root UI):** `run_app.py`
	1. Ensures prototype `src` path in `sys.path`.
	2. Instantiates `MainUI()` and starts `QApplication` loop.
- **UI Flow:**
	- Aadhaar → Biometric → Voting.
	- Voting calls `VoteStorage.store_vote`, which decrypts `votes.json`, appends vote, encrypts.
- **Touchscreen Orchestrator (`src/main.py`):**
	1. `SecureBoot.verify_integrity()` prints success.
	2. `DeviceManager.initialize_all()` calls sensor init.
	3. `BlockchainClient.connect()` prints connected.
	4. `TouchscreenUI.run()` captures devices, logs, simulates selection, calls `BlockchainClient.submit_vote()`.
- **Key Algorithms/Rules:**
	- Aadhaar validation: length=12, numeric.
	- Face anomaly: >1 faces warn.
	- Fernet encryption per vote list write.
- **Configuration & Env Vars:** None defined in repo. Path manipulations exist in `run_app.py`.
- **Feature Flags:** Simulation mode appears in `BiometricCaptureScreen` via `simulate_biometric()`; no global flags.
- **Interfaces/Contracts:** Device FFI expects `.so` libraries with `initialize`/`capture*` functions; Rust crypto expects `crypto.so` functions.

---

## 6) Data Layer & Storage

- **Type:** Encrypted JSON file (`votes.json`) with Fernet.
- **Schema (implicit):** `{ election_type, party_name, timestamp }` per vote.
- **Migrations:** Not applicable (file-based).
- **Indexing/Performance:** No indexes; sequential list; small-scale prototype.
- **Caching:** None.
- **Retention/Cleanup:** `initialize_storage()` resets to empty encrypted list.

---

## 7) API Documentation

Not found in repository.
- No REST/gRPC servers or endpoint definitions present.
- `BlockchainClient` does not expose HTTP APIs; it is a client.

---

## 8) Authentication & Authorization

- **Mechanism:** Not present in repository (no JWT/session/OAuth). UI uses simple local validation (Aadhaar length) and simulated biometrics.
- **Roles/Permissions:** Not present.
- **Token Handling:** Not present.
- **Access Control Enforcement:** UI gating via success states only.

---

## 9) Security Review (Detailed)

Threat Model
- **Assets:** Votes (`votes.json`), audit logs (`audit_log.enc`), Fernet key (`key.key`), device integrity, biometric captures.
- **Actors:** Voters, Admins/Operators, Potential adversaries (tamper, spoofing, malware).
- **Trust Boundaries:** UI ↔ hardware devices; local storage ↔ blockchain client; FFI boundaries (Rust/C++ libraries).

Findings
- **Secrets Management:**
	- `utils/logger.py` uses a hardcoded Fernet key (`b'your-encryption-key'`) → must be replaced with secure secret loading.
	- `key.key` is stored alongside code (both root and `src/`) → move to secure secret store; rotate keys.
- **Supply Chain / Dependencies:**
	- `requirements.txt` missing packages used in code: `web3`, `opencv-python`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, `tensorflow`, `pyserial`.
	- No lockfile present; recommend pinning versions.
- **FFI Risks:** `crypto.so` and hardware `.so` libraries are not present → loading will fail; ensure signed binaries and strict path controls.
- **Input Validation:** Aadhaar numeric/length check only; voter ID unchecked; biometric capture simulated. Add strong validation.
- **Logging Sensitivity:** Ensure audit log excludes PII; encrypted log key must be protected.
- **Secure Defaults Checklist:**
	- [ ] No hardcoded keys or secrets.
	- [ ] Enforce least privilege for file access.
	- [ ] Validate all inputs (Aadhaar format, voter ID, image data).
	- [ ] Fail closed on device/crypto load errors.
	- [ ] Pin dependencies; run SCA.

Security TODO (Prioritized)
1. Remove hardcoded key in `utils/logger.py`; load from env/secret vault.
2. Move `key.key` out of repo; add `.gitignore` and secret loading.
3. Add robust validation and error handling paths across UI/Backend.
4. Create a secure `requirements.txt` with all used deps and pin versions; add SCA in CI.
5. Sign and verify FFI libraries; add integrity checks.
6. Implement RBAC for admin-only views (counting, dashboard).

---

## 10) Observability & Operations

- **Logging:** `utils/logger.Logger.log()` prints `[LOG] ...` and writes encrypted entries to `audit_log.enc`. No correlation IDs; recommend adding.
- **Metrics/Tracing:** Not present.
- **Health Checks:** Not present; consider adding device readiness checks and UI heartbeat.
- **Alerting Recommendations:** Set SLOs around device init success rate, vote write latency, camera availability.
- **Failure Modes & Diagnosis:**
	- Missing `.so` libraries → import errors; check `src/hardware` and `src/blockchain` FFI.
	- Camera access denied → OpenCV warnings; verify permissions and device index.
	- Fernet decrypt errors → key mismatch; ensure `key.key` matches `votes.json` encryption.

## 11) Deployment

Supported Modes
- **Local Dev:** PyQt UI via root `run_app.py`.
- **Docker:** Not found in repository.
- **Kubernetes:** Not found in repository.
- **Cloud:** Not found in repository.

Build/Run
```powershell
# From repo root (Windows PowerShell)
# 1) Python env (recommended)
python -m venv .venv; .\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

# 2) Install dependencies
pip install -r "Phase 1A - Foundation/Month 3 - Prototype Development/EVM IoT Application/requirements.txt"
# Dependencies are consolidated in the existing requirements.txt

# 3) Run the PyQt UI
python .\run_app.py

# Alternative orchestrator (prototype runner)
python "Phase 1A - Foundation/Month 3 - Prototype Development/EVM IoT Application/src/main.py"
```

Runtime Requirements
- Windows with Python 3.11+, PyQt5, OpenCV camera access, optional compiled `.so`/`.dll` drivers (not provided).

Ports/Volumes/Networking
- No network servers in UI; blockchain client connects to `http://127.0.0.1:8545` (placeholder).

CI/CD
- Not found in repository (no `.github/workflows`, no pipeline files).

Release Strategy
- Not defined; recommend semantic versioning and signed releases.

## 12) Configuration Reference

Environment Variables & Config Files

Not found in repository (no `.env`, no config module). Suggested variables:

| Name | Required | Default | Example | Impact |
|------|----------|---------|---------|--------|
| `VOTE_STORAGE_PATH` | Optional | `votes.json` | `C:\\data\\votes.enc` | Where encrypted votes are stored |
| `FERNET_KEY_PATH` | Required | `key.key` | `C:\\secrets\\vote_fernet.key` | Key file for `VoteStorage` |
| `AUDIT_LOG_PATH` | Optional | `audit_log.enc` | `C:\\logs\\audit_log.enc` | Encrypted audit log location |
| `WEB3_PROVIDER_URL` | Optional | `http://127.0.0.1:8545` | `https://rpc.chain.example` | Blockchain node URL |
| `CONTRACT_ADDRESS` | Optional | `0xYourContractAddress` | `0xABC...` | Vote contract address |

`.env.example` (recommended to create)
```dotenv
VOTE_STORAGE_PATH=./votes.json
FERNET_KEY_PATH=./key.key
AUDIT_LOG_PATH=./audit_log.enc
WEB3_PROVIDER_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8545
CONTRACT_ADDRESS=0xYourContractAddress
```

## 13) Testing

- **Structure:** `tests/` exists but is empty.
- **Strategy:** Not defined.
- **How to Run:** Not applicable.
- **Gaps:** No unit/integration/e2e tests; UI/FFI-heavy code needs mocks and simulators.
- **Mocking:** Not implemented; recommend mocking hardware and blockchain clients.

---

## 14) Contribution & Development Workflow

Local Setup
```powershell
# Clone, create venv, install deps
python -m venv .venv; .\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
pip install -r "Phase 1A - Foundation/Month 3 - Prototype Development/EVM IoT Application/requirements.txt"
pip install web3 opencv-python numpy scikit-learn tensorflow pyserial
```

Dev Commands
- Run UI: `python .\run_app.py`
- Orchestrator: `python "Phase 1A - Foundation/Month 3 - Prototype Development/EVM IoT Application/src/main.py"`

Branching/Review
- Not found in repository (no documented conventions).

Coding Standards
- Python style: mixed; no linters/formatters configured; recommend `ruff`, `black`, `mypy`.

---

## 15) Troubleshooting

- **ModuleNotFoundError (backend):** Ensure `src` path is in `sys.path` (root `run_app.py` does this).
- **Camera index errors:** Check device presence; adjust index in `biometric_capture.py`.
- **Fernet decrypt failures:** `key.key` mismatch with `votes.json`; reinitialize via `VoteStorage.initialize_storage()` (will erase votes).
- **FFI load errors:** Missing `.so`/`.dll` files for `crypto_bridge.py` or `hardware/biometric.py`; build and place libraries next to Python files.
- **web3 connection refused:** Ensure local node at `127.0.0.1:8545` is running or set `WEB3_PROVIDER_URL`.

---

## 16) Roadmap & Technical Debt (Inferred)

- **TODOs/Placeholders:**
	- Rust `crypto.so` and C++ driver `.so` files are not present.
	- Blockchain contract ABI/address placeholders; no transaction submission.
	- `utils/logger.py` hardcoded key.
	- Missing dependency pins and SCA.
	- Empty `tests/`.
- **Hardcoded Configs:** Provider URL, contract address, key paths.
- **Fragile Areas:** Path manipulation in `src/run_app.py`; error handling around encryption/IO.
- **Prioritized Improvements:** Security fixes (secrets), dependency pinning, proper DI/config, test coverage, CI, on-chain integration.

---

## 17) Appendix

Glossary
- **Fernet:** Symmetric encryption providing authenticated encryption.
- **FFI:** Foreign Function Interface; cross-language calls (Python→Rust/C++).
- **ArcFace:** Face recognition model producing embeddings for similarity comparison.

Dependency Summary
- From `requirements.txt`: `pyqt5`, `requests`, `cryptography`, `protobuf`, `grpcio`.
- Used in code but missing: `web3`, `opencv-python`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, `tensorflow`, `pyserial`.

License
- Not found in repository.
